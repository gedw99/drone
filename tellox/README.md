Fuse everything over NATS in both directions so that its easy to use.

Add NATS logging. https://github.com/LuBashQ/natzap SO we can see the data and debug.

Ideas

## GUI Pipes

GUI with pipes so you can reconfigure the dats stream.

Feedback loops into Deck and renders the data values.

- WASM for each worker

- NATS for pipng one worker into another

## Mapping

Same as above but the location is streaming to a map, so you can see where ona maps

## Video

Frames piped out, so you can correlated the maps position with the video frame positions.
